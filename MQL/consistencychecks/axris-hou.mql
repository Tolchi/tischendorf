 * AXRIS/AXRI/MEXRIS/MEXRI hOU
 *
 * Hypothesis: All instances of AXRIS/AXRI/MEXRIS/MEXRI + OU
 * have R-GSM as the parsing of OU.
 *
 * Test: Test for AXRIS/AXRI/MEXRIS/MEXRI followed by OU that does not
 * have R-GSM as the parsing.
 *
 * If even one shows up, it is falsified.
 *
 * Result: This was not falsified.
