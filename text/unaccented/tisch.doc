      The Greek Text corresponds to the printed text found in:

 Tischendorf, Constantinus, Novum Testamentum Graece, editio octava
 critica major Vol. I, 1869; Vol. II 1872, Leipzig:Giesecke and
 Devrient. Vol 3, Prolegomena, ed. by Caspar Rene' Gregory, Leipzig:
 Hinrichs, 1894.

   The text contains no accents or diacritical marks.  This text was
 prepared from the Westcott-Hort-Nestle Aland text found in the Greek text
 prepared by Dr. Maurice Robinson. Available FTP: ftp://:@archimedes.nosc.
 mil:21/pub/gnt/ File whn26.zip. The text was compared to the printed
 edition of Tischendorf's. Changes were made in the text to make it
 correspond to the printed edition. The text was proofed against
 the Tischendorf text.

      The present plan is to scan in, key in corrections and proof the
 complete critical apparatus of Tischendorf's. The apparatus will then
 be in text format available to any one who would like to use it for
 research or incorporate it into a Bible software program. I have been
 informed that this is not an easy task. I am very aware of the complexity
 of the text and the pitfalls of such a colossal undertaking.  The apparatus
 will be released as each book is completed.

   According to J. Harold Greenlee "His 'eighth major edition' (1869-72) contains
 a critical apparatus which has never been equaled in comprehensiveness of
 citation of Greek mss., versions, and patristic evidence. A century later it is
 still indispensable for serious work in the text of the N.T."

    The Greek and Hebrew words are being tagged using the scheme found in
 the Online Bible program. The transliteration scheme will allow it to be read by
 the Online Bible program.

    The Greek text is released as a public domain text. 

    If any errors are found in this text please let me know as soon as
 possible.
