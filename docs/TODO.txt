TODO for Tischendorf

- Linguistics

  - [X] Consistency checks...

  - [X] Check that N-PRI is really indeclinable

  - [X] Check up on the difference between MIKRON 3397 and MIKROS 3398

  - [X] Finish going through ambiguities in
        tischlexicon_nonunique.txt.

  - [X] Make AGNT-lemmatable

  - [X] Check Strong's lemmatable against the one from SWORD.  This
        will involve transliterating my lemmatable to the phonetic
        transcription of the SWORD dictionary.  This shouldn't be
        hard.

  - [X] Check unparsed base-text against Clint Yale's accented text.

  - [X] Check all unique nouns of type neuter, accusative or
        nominative.

  - [X] Check [1 in lemmatable.


- Text

  - [X] Check all chapter-beginnings which do not start in a capital letter.

    - [X] Bob Pritchett  bob@logos.com

    - [X] John Baima   jbaima@silvermnt.com

    - [X] Crosswire  Troy A. Griffitts <scribe@crosswire.org>

    - [-] NOT Accordance -- they have a tagged Tischendorf already.

    - [-] NOT Bertram Salzmann salzmann@dbg.de -- since Bob Pritchett
          wants to carry it.

  - [X] See if you can find other hosting (e.g., Crosswire)

  - [X] Announce it on B-Greek.

  - [X] Make initial, small website

  - [X] Write introductory notes (probably short)

     - [X] Write a first draft (Word/RTF)

     - [X] Get Maurice Robinson and Clint Yale to comment on it.

  - [ ] Write an article about it.

  - [ ] Write a press release


- Software

  - [X] Make code to apply AGNT-lemmatable rather than Strong's lemma-table

  - [ ] Write export to:

    - [ ] OSIS

    - [ ] PalmBible+

    - [ ] OLB format
